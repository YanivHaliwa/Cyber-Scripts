# Vuln - Unified Vulnerability Search Tool

A command-line tool that searches for exploits and vulnerability information across multiple security databases.

## Description

`vuln` searches across various vulnerability sources from a single interface, making it easier for security professionals to quickly find information about specific exploits.

## Features

- Searches across multiple vulnerability sources simultaneously:
  - ExploitDB (via searchsploit)
  - Metasploit Framework modules
  - AttackerKB vulnerability topics
  - National Vulnerability Database (NVD)
- Parallel searching for quick results
- Threat intelligence provided in a unified, color-coded interface
- Automatic version detection to find version-specific exploits
- Interactive prompt to:
  - Copy exploits to your current directory
  - Launch Metasploit with the selected module
  - Open web links to vulnerability information

## Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- Metasploit Framework installed and in PATH
- SearchSploit installed and in PATH
- AttackerKB Python API client: `pip install attackerkb-api`
- Beautiful Soup: `pip install beautifulsoup4`
- Requests: `pip install requests`

## Setup

1. Install the required Python packages:
   ```
   pip install attackerkb-api beautifulsoup4 requests
   ```

2. Ensure Metasploit and SearchSploit are installed and accessible from PATH

3. Set your AttackerKB API key as an environment variable:
   ```
   export ATTACKERKB_API_KEY="your-api-key"
   ```


### Installation

you can clone ONLY this folder if you run this command: 

```bash
git clone --filter=blob:none --no-checkout https://github.com/YanivHaliwa/Cyber-Stuff.git && cd Cyber-Stuff && git sparse-checkout init --cone && git sparse-checkout set vulnerability_search  && git checkout
```

OR you can Clone the repository using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YanivHaliwa/Cyber-Stuff.git
cd Cyber-Stuff/vulnerability_search
```

## Usage

```
./vuln [options] query
```

### Options

- `-s, --searchsploit`: Include Exploit-DB results
- `-m, --msf`: Include Metasploit module results
- `-a, --attackerkb`: Include AttackerKB topic results
- `-n, --nvd`: Include NVD CVE results
- `-e, --everything`: Include all sources

### Examples

```
# Default: search across local db, AttackKB, and Metasploit
vuln sudo

# Search apache in msfconsole and NVD only
vuln apache -m -n

# Search mysql across all sources
vuln mysql --everything

# Exploit-DB search for WordPress 5.4
vuln 'wordpress 5.4' -s
